<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://proverbialsoup.com)

Beneficial sayings worth repeating and sharing in real life (or Online). Quotes curated by David McClatchey.

Proverbs of a nature which stimulate maturity and genuine progress for all kinds of purpose-driven people. Displayed as high quality images with embedded text in a perfect square for maximum sharability.

Here's why:
* You are thinking about where you are, and where you want to be
* You are open to keeping the wisest thoughts of others close to your own wisest thoughts
* You want to share your best with others, so that everybody can be their best too :smile:

Of course, this idea is simple, and has many flaws; in some ways it is just like us, and will continue to grow into something better. This is a learning project for me, and my journey into web-development is happening right here for all to see. Flaws and perfections!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/McKlatch/ProvSoup/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

I'm not really open to other contributors on this project. Proverbial Soup is intentionally a challenge for me to work on alone. This is so that I can learn what problems exist in web development, and how to solve them, by and for myself. One day, I will be able to solve such problems professionally ðŸ’µ.
